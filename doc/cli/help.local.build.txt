Usage: $0 local build <platform>

Description:

  Build your application to a specific platform.

  Build will happen locally on your system. This requires that
  the <platform> SDK environment is correctly installed.

  After the build, the <platform> may attempt to install the
  app on an emulator or device. The command-line output will
  explain what is happening. This is an inconsistency in the
  Apache Cordova project that is actively being resolved.

Examples:

  $ $0 local build android
